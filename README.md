# Tornado_Prediction
My first repository on GitHub for codefundo++.

Tornadoes are violently rotating air columns that start as a thunderstorm and extends to the ground which can happen anytime and anywhere causing massive damage to human life and property. At present, the technology available with the meteorologists can detect tornadoes by analysing rotating funnel clouds in their early stages but not more than 15 minutes in advance. Meteorologists also use Doppler Radar which measures wind speed and direction at a particular region to get a suitable prediction.
The solution available with us is through a website or an application which can predict whether a storm currently in air is going to intensify, weaken or has the ability to turn into a tornado using data assimilation. The website needs to be fed with a good amount of satellite images and other related data provided by the meteorological department that would help in the prediction of tornado by identifying the patterns of cloud funnelling. 
The solution that we intend to provide aims to optimise the available solutions that can provide faster predictions and alert the normal public beforehand.
